### All DONE!

- This project heavly relies on [Croods](https://croods-docz.netlify.com) and [Croods-auth](https://croods-docz.netlify.com) projects. Make sure you read their docs.
- If you want to add context providers for your whole app, edit the `./src/core/Providers.js` file.
- There are some built in helpers (`./src/utils/helpers.js`) and hooks (`./src/utils/hooks.js`). Make sure you get to know them before you start rewriting them.
- If you want to enable/disable custom lint rules, edit the `.eslintrc.js` file.
