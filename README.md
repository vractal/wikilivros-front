### Checklist

- [ ] Change the image on `./public/favicon.png`.
- [ ] Start editing the content on the pages under `./src/pages/`, and creating new ones by adding new routes on `./src/App.js`
- [ ] Edit `./src/core/AuthRoute.js` if you want to change the way you handle protected routes.
- [ ] Add your global styles to `./src/index.css`. For styling your pages and components, use either `withStyles` from MaterialUI or emotion-css.

### All DONE!

- This project heavly relies on [Croods](https://croods-docz.netlify.com) and [Croods-auth](https://croods-docz.netlify.com) projects. Make sure you read their docs.
- If you want to add context providers for your whole app, edit the `./src/core/Providers.js` file.
- There are some built in components (`./src/components/*`), helpers (`./src/utils/helpers.js`) and hooks (`./src/utils/hooks.js`). Make sure you get to know them before you start rewriting them.
- If you want to enable/disable custom lint rules, edit the `.eslintrc.js` file.
- Don't forget to edit this `README.md` for your own needs.
